1. Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with boot/boot.S. Bearing in mind that
kern/mpentry.S is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE just like everything
else in the kernel, what is the purpose of macro MPBOOTPHYS? Why is it necessary
in kern/mpentry.S but not in boot/boot.S? In other words, what could go wrong if
it were omitted in kern/mpentry.S? Hint: recall the differences between the link
address and the load address that we have discussed in Lab 1.

Answer:
The MPBOOTPHYS macro is required to calculate the absolute address of symbols by
subtracting mpentry_start and the physical address where MPENTRY is loaded into
memory (0x7000). This is because the linker does not know that we are loading
this code into memory at this address, so it would not calculate correct
addresses for the code.

2. It seems that using the big kernel lock guarantees that only one CPU can run
the kernel code at a time. Why do we still need separate kernel stacks for each
CPU? Describe a scenario in which using a shared kernel stack will go wrong,
even with the protection of the big kernel lock.

Answer:
The big kernel lock doesn't protect the stack from things being written to it by
systems such as the trapping functions that can write to the stack before
fully transitioning control to the kernel. So even if CPU0 has the kernel lock,
a trap can be raised by CPU1 which would copy the trapframe onto the stack
before kernel code running on CPU1 tries to get the big kernel lock. This could
corrupt the stack data that CPU0 is expecting to see.

3. In your implementation of env_run() you should have called lcr3(). Before and
after the call to lcr3(), your code makes references (at least it should) to the
variable e, the argument to env_run. Upon loading the %cr3 register, the
addressing context used by the MMU is instantly changed. But a virtual address
(namely e) has meaning relative to a given address context–the address context
specifies the physical address to which the virtual address maps. Why can the
pointer e be dereferenced both before and after the addressing switch?

Answer:
The VA space of all envs is identical above UTOP except for UVPT, so regardless
of what page directory we're using, the virtual mapping of the variable e will
be the same.

4. Whenever the kernel switches from one environment to another, it must ensure
the old environment’s registers are saved so they can be restored properly
later. Why? Where does this happen?

Answer:
The kernel has to save this so that when an environment is returned to, it can
resume execution at exactly the point where it left off. Not only where the
instruction pointer is, but also the stack pointer and all register contents are
vital to ensuring that the environment picks up right where it left off. The
register contents are saved into the env_tf when a trap occurs, and are restored
by env_pop_tf in env_run() when a new environment is scheduled on the processor
